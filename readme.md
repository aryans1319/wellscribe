## Usage
Implemented a real-time user management system using React, Node.js, and MongoDB. The system should
render and fetch all users' data in a table format. Additionally, it should dynamically update the table
whenever a new user is created or existing user details are updated, without requiring a page reload.
**Note: The data is updated dynamically without requiring a page reload so there is no need for sockets here from my point of view**
